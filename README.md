# Compas System

This project involves loading and analyzing data for the COMPAS system, focusing on integrity, validity, and timeliness. It assesses specific fields for risk estimates, creates a contingency table for preventive measures against recidivism, and examines potential biases in risk assignments by gender and race. The final analysis evaluates the COMPAS system's predictive capacity for general crimes versus violent offenses.
